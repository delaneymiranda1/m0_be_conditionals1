# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
When you need to instruct your computer to make a decision based on a condition.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I started practicing the code in terminal first, when I should have just written it in VS code and checked my work by running the file.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
I hit a block when writing the code for if statements and I went back and read through the other practices and figured out what to do. That was very helpful because I screenshotted how I worked through the other practices and I had good reference examples.
